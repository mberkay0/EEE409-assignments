Machine Learning or automatic learning is a scientific field, and more specifically a subcategory of artificial intelligence. It consists of letting algorithms discover “patterns”, namely recurring patterns, in data sets. Anything that can be stored digitally can serve as data for Machine Learning. By detecting patterns in this data, algorithms learn and improve their performance in performing a specific task [1].

* Supervised Learning
  * Regression
  * Classification
